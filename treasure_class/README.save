Homework 2, Part 1 - X Marks the Spot!

You will need to write two classes, one called Spot and one called Treasure.

Spot will hold potential dig sites for digging up treasure. The Treasure class
will define a rectangular region on the ground where a treasure might be
found. In part 2 of this assignment, we'll write a treasure hunt program.
For now, we're just going to build the classes we need.

All your code must be within the file treas.cc. It must be organized like
this from the top of the file to the bottom:
1) Spot must be in the source code above Treasure
2) Treasure must be above your main() function.
3) Your main() function.

Nothing inside of your main() will be graded (it will
actually be snipped out by the autograder), so feel free to put whatever
you want inside there and test the hell out of your Spot and Treasure Code.

Your assignment: 

Part A) Write Spot. Spot is a very simple class. You must implement the following:
1) Make sure it's called Spot (exactly "Spot" - including the capital S).
2) It should have two private member variables to hold the x and y coordinates
that the Spot represents.

In the public: section you should have:
3) Write a constructor that takes two parameters to initialize both
the x and y private member variables
4) (Optional) It can have a default constructor that sets both to 0
5) It should have get/set methods for both private member variables. They
should have the following signatures:
int get_x()
int get_y()
int set_x(int new_x)
int set_y(int new_y)
6) Write a function called distance() that computes the distance the Spot is
away from the origin (0,0). It takes no parameters It must return an int.
The formula to compute the distance from the origin is just the Pythagorean theorem:
sqrt(x*x+y*y) 
In order to call the sqrt function, you must #include <cmath>, but I've
already done that for you at the top of the file.
7) In no case should the class allow setting an x or y position greater than
99 or less than 0. If the user tries to do this, set the position to 0
instead.

Part B) Write Treasure. Treasure will define a rectangle, with a minimum and maximum x
and y values that represent where the treasure can be found on a field. It
will also hold the value of the treasure. All five of these are integers.

1) Make sure this class is called Treasure.
2) Have five private member variables to hold the minimum and maximum x and y
coordinates, plus the value of the treasure.
In the public section:
3) Write a constructor that takes five parameters, that
will set each of these five private member variables.
4) (Optional) Write a default constructor that sets all five private member
variables to zero.
5) Write the following get/set functions whose signatures I provide:
int get_x_min()
int get_y_min()
int get_x_max()
int get_y_max()
int get_value()
void set_x_min(int new_x_min)
void set_y_min(int new_y_min)
void set_x_max(int new_x_max)
void set_y_max(int new_y_max)
void set_value(int new_value)
6) Write a member function called within() that takes a Spot as a parameter.
It will return true if that Spot is within the rectangle defined by the
Treasure, false otherwise. For example, if our minimum x is 10 and our maximum
x is 20, and ditto for y, and we pass in a Spot with x and y both 15, then
this spot is within the rectangle defined by us, and so we return true.
7) Write a function called loot(). It will return an integer, and take no
parameters. The first time a treasure gets looted, it will return the value of
int get_x_min()
int get_y_min()
int get_x_max()
int get_y_max()
int get_value()
void set_x_min(int new_x_min)
void set_y_min(int new_y_min)
void set_x_max(int new_x_max)
void set_y_max(int new_y_max)
void set_value(int new_value)
the treasure, and set its value to 0. (Treasure can only be looted once.) If
loot gets called on the treasure again, it will return 0.
8) In no case can a x or y minimum or maximum be greater than 99 or less than
0. Set it to the nearest number (99 if too big, 0 if too small).
9) In no case can .value be negative. Set it to 0 if the value is < 0.
10) In no case can x_maximum be smaller than x_minimum (and ditto for y). If
the user of your code tries to set it that way, set it to the lowest number
possible. For example, if x_minimum is 10, and I try setting your x_maximum to
3, it will get set to 10 instead.
11) Ditto for trying to set the minimum bigger than the maximum.

Make sure you test your code thoroughly in your main function.
When you're ready to see that it's good to go, issue the following commands:
make clean
make 
a.out

You should only need to do a make clean when switching from your main file to
the main file used by my testing code.

If it says "PASSED ALL TESTS" then yay, you're done!
If not, read which test you failed and try to fix it.
