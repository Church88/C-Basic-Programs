For this assignment, you will write a text predicter, like you might have on
your smartphone. Rather than predicting whole words, you will simply suggest
what the next letter could be.

In other words, if a user types "Goodby", your program might suggest the
letter E.

The program will first load a dictionary, and then it will load words it will
do prediction for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1: You will read one line at a time from standard input. Each line is a
word from the dictionary. Store these in a data structure.

You will continue reading one line at a time until you read a "-----"

(The ----- will not be entered into the dictionary.)

You should uppercaseify all words, as case doesn't matter for spelling in the
English language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 2: The user will input, one line at a time, words to do predictive text
for. Your code will output all possible letters that could come next (using
the dictionary to tell which letters are possible).

These letters will all be uppercase. (Again, case doesn't matter in spellin'.)

Output these letters in alphabetical order
Example input:
aab
aaa
aac
KingKerney
----
aa

Example output:
ABC

Why is that the output? Because there's three words in the dictionary that
start with aa: aaa, aab, and aac. So when we ask what could come after "aa"
the answer is: either the 'a', 'b', or 'c' character.

Unlike normally, KingKerney doesn't matter here.
