			TRIANGLE COMPETITION
========================================

Welcome to Major League Programming!

The thrill of victory!
The agony of defeat!
(Or vice versa.)

Tonight's competition will be a timed
event that will challenge your ability
to write correct code quickly in tandem
with a partner.

========================================

Your program will calculate the area
of a triangle three different ways:

1. Calculating the area of a right
triangle, whose bottom left corner is on
the origin, the second corner lies
on the x axis, with a coordinate of x, and 
the third corner on the y axis, with a
coordinate of y. x and y are values
passed in by the user.

2. Calculating the area of an equilateral
triangle whose *height* is x. X is entered
by the user.

3. Calculating the area of an equilateral
triangle whose side is given by the user.
The user will input x1 y1 x2 y2 in that
order, which is the coordinates for one
of the lines that make up the triangle.

4. You must write a main function that will
prompt the user: "Do you want to calculate
the area of 1) A right triangle, 2) an
equilateral triangle based on height, or
3) an equilateral triangle based on side
length?" and input 1, 2, or 3.

If the choice is 1, then the program will
prompt the user to "Input the x and y
coordinates of the right triangle: ", and then
output the area of the triangle, followed by
a newline.

If the choice is 2, then the program will
prompt the user to "Enter the height of the 
triangle: ". The program will then output the
area of the triangle, followed by a newline.

If the choice is 3, then the program will
prompt the user to "Enter four numbers: "
which will be x1 y1 x2 y2. The program will
calculate the length of the line segment
entered by the user (it will not output this
number) and then it will output the area of
the triangle, followed by a newline.

========================================

Important Notes:

In all cases above, the area must be
POSITIVE.

Use floats for all your calculations,
or your answers will not be right.

Do not use endlines in any of your cout
statements except where explicitly said.

If the user makes a choice not 1,2,or 3
then output "INVALID INPUT" and quit.

========================================

Scoring:
5 points for completing the assignment before
the end of class.
5 points for being the first group to complete
5 points for being the group to pass the most
test cases.
